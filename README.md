# 🧠 Automation Playground: Selenium & Cypress Unified

Welcome to the **Automation Playground**—a public sandbox where Selenium and Cypress meet to test, teach, and transcend. This isn't just a demo site. It's a living ritual for mastering automation, decoding systems, and architecting influence.

## 🚀 Purpose

This site exists to:
- Simulate real-world UI flows for automation testing
- Serve as a dual-framework testing ground (Selenium + Cypress)
- Showcase best practices in test design, performance, and resilience
- Inspire engineers to move from script writers to system architects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech Used                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend     | HTML, CSS, JS                 |

## 🌱 Philosophy

Automation isn’t just about speed—it’s about **clarity, control, and legacy**. This site is part of a larger movement to:
- Elevate testing from task to ritual
- Design systems that outlast their creators
- Build onboarding experiences that heal and energize teams
